# OksanaC

Programming language based on the one-liners of Oksana (forked from ArnoldC)

## Building
in order to build, you need to use java 8 or older.
run:
```sbt assembly```

## Motivation

Although the one-liners of Oksana are fairly well known the true semantics of the uttering is yet to be understood. This project tries to discover new meanings from the Arnold movies with the means of computer science.
